Lets get start with MongoDB

1. it is a No-SQL Document Based Database
2. it give strong support for Aggregation Pipes
3. Works on BSON format
4. it is Best for Node Application

* in mongo db we have collection incited of table
* in mongo db we have document incited of row
* in mongo db we have field incited of column


* first command to start the mongoDb shell is :- mongosh
* to create a database in mongoDb we use the following command :- db.createDatabase("database_name")
* to create a collection in mongoDb we use the following command :- db.createCollection("collection_name
* to insert a document in mongoDb we use the following command :- db.collection_name.insertOne({"
* to access all database we use command :-show database
* to access all collection we use command :- show collections
* to access all document we use command :- db.collection_name.find()
* if you want to use existing database jus write use database database_name
* to see all dat inside the data base we use command :- db.users.find({}) 
* to insert the data we use command :- db.databaseName.insert({})
* to delete the data we use command :- db.databaseName.remove({})



To connect the mongoDb to nodeApplication we should first install the mongoose in our npm 
command is :-npm i mongoose

 Schema-define the structure 
we make Model
schema-Model
and perform  crud operation

*to connect the mongo db we use :-mongo.connect("pass the url of your mongo url/yourDatabase name")

*after creating schema we have to create a model then do connection

*without schema model it will not create database


*IMP the res.send ,res.end both are different 
res.send :- res.send is used to send the data to the client
res.end :- res.end is used to end the response of the client
