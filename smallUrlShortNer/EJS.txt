let's see how we use ssr in express 
basically ssr is server side rendering which give response as html file 
there are multiple tool for that but we will focus to EJS (Embedded javascript template)
first we will install the ejs in our application using command npm i ejs
after that we set the ejs in our main application in node using  app.set("view engine","ejs")
then we will create a new file in our view folder and name it as index.ejs and write the html code 
we will also give path of our file to our express by initializing path 
app.set("view,path of file)
